<h1>Connect-4 AI with Minimax and Alpha-beta pruning</h1>
<p>This project was made for homework under UNESP Artificial Intelligence class.</p>
<p>To play, run <code>interface.py</code> with a Python interpreter. Click the arrows at the top to place your chips.</p>
<p>The maximum depth can be adjusted in <code>board.py</code> via the <code>MAX_DEPTH</code> constant. Higher values produce better outcomes but also
slows down the "thinking time" of the AI considerably</p>
<p>Run <code>interface.py -auto</code> for an AI vs AI showdown.</p>
